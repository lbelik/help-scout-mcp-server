## What's New in v1.8.0

- **Inline Image Extraction**: Customer-pasted screenshots (inline `<img>` tags) are now preserved instead of silently stripped by HTML cleaning. Each image is replaced with a `[Image N: alt]` text placeholder, and full metadata (`src`, `alt`, `width`, `height`, `isFetchable`) is returned alongside the thread body.
  - `getThreads` — Threads with inline images now include `inlineImages` array and `inlineImageCount`
  - `getConversationSummary` — `firstCustomerMessage` and `latestStaffReply` include inline image metadata when present
  - Tracking pixels (1x1 images) are automatically filtered out
  - `isFetchable` flag distinguishes downloadable `https://` URLs from `cid:` and `data:` URIs

### Previous Release (v1.7.0)

- **Attachment Support**: Two new tools for viewing customer-attached screenshots and files:
  - `getAttachments` — Lists attachment metadata (filename, size, mimeType) for all threads in a conversation, without downloading binary data
  - `getAttachmentData` — Downloads a specific attachment; small images (< 1MB) are returned inline for Claude to see, larger files are saved to a temp path
- **Claude Code Auto-Fetch**: Shared skill file (`.claude/skills/attachment-handling.md`) wires attachment tools into `/ticket`, `/investigate-ticket`, and `/helpscout conversation` commands — screenshots display inline automatically, no manual tool calls needed
- **Token Savings**: `getThreads` now strips `_embedded` attachment objects (which were serialized as unread noise) and replaces them with a lightweight `attachmentCount` field per thread
- **Virus Protection**: Attachments flagged as `state: "virus"` are surfaced with warnings in `getAttachments` and blocked from download in `getAttachmentData`
- **Reports API**: Four new tools for agent and team performance analytics:
  - `listUsers` — List all Help Scout agents with IDs, emails, and roles
  - `getCompanyReport` — All agents compared side-by-side in one call (replies, customers helped, happiness)
  - `getUserReport` — Deep dive on a single agent (response time, resolution time, handle time)
  - `getProductivityReport` — Team-wide metrics (first response time, handle time distributions, replies per resolution)

### Previous Release (v1.6.2)

- **Date Filter Fix**: `createdAfter` and `timeframeDays` now correctly filter by conversation creation date instead of last modification date. Previously, all search tools mapped `createdAfter` to Help Scout's `modifiedSince` API parameter, silently excluding conversations that were created within the timeframe but not recently modified. Now uses Help Scout query syntax `createdAt:[date TO *]` for accurate creation-date filtering.
- **Multi-Status Search Consistency**: `advancedConversationSearch` and `structuredConversationFilter` now search all statuses (active, pending, closed) by default, matching the behavior established in v1.6.0 for `searchConversations`. Previously, omitting the status parameter silently returned only active conversations.
- **Ticket Number Lookup Fix**: `structuredConversationFilter` with `conversationNumber` now finds conversations regardless of status. Previously, looking up a closed ticket by number returned empty results.

### Previous Release (v1.6.1)

- **Pagination Bug Fix**: Multi-status searches now report accurate total counts with `totalAvailable` and `totalByStatus` breakdown ([#10](https://github.com/drewburchfield/help-scout-mcp-server/issues/10))
- **Client-Side Date Filtering**: New `createdBefore` parameter for all search tools
- **Partial Failure Transparency**: Multi-status searches surface structured error info when individual status queries fail
- **Dependency Security Fixes**: Upgraded `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to 1.26.0, fixed axios, hono, and qs vulnerabilities

### Previous Release (v1.6.0)

- **Inbox Auto-Discovery**: Inboxes automatically discovered on server connect and included in server instructions
- **Multi-Status Search Default**: `searchConversations` searches all statuses (active, pending, closed) by default when no status specified
- **Simpler Workflow**: AI agents can use inbox IDs directly from server instructions without a preliminary lookup step

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (for command line usage)
- **Help Scout Account** with API access
- **OAuth2 App** from Help Scout (App ID and App Secret)
- **Claude Desktop** (for extension installation) or any MCP-compatible client

> **Note**: The desktop extension bundles Node.js, so no local installation needed for Claude Desktop users.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Claude Desktop (One-Click Install)

Easiest setup using [Desktop Extensions](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/desktop-extensions) - no configuration needed:

1. Download the latest [`.mcpb` file from releases](https://github.com/drewburchfield/help-scout-mcp-server/releases)
2. Double-click to install (or drag into Claude Desktop window)
3. Enter your Help Scout App ID and App Secret when prompted
4. Start using immediately

### Option 2: JSON Config (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)

Add to your MCP client's config file (e.g., `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "helpscout": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["help-scout-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "HELPSCOUT_APP_ID": "your-app-id",
        "HELPSCOUT_APP_SECRET": "your-app-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Docker

```bash
docker run -e HELPSCOUT_APP_ID="your-app-id" \
  -e HELPSCOUT_APP_SECRET="your-app-secret" \
  drewburchfield/help-scout-mcp-server
```

### Option 4: Command Line (Claude Code, Codex, etc.)

```bash
HELPSCOUT_APP_ID="your-app-id" \
HELPSCOUT_APP_SECRET="your-app-secret" \
npx help-scout-mcp-server
```

## Getting Your API Credentials

### OAuth2 Client Credentials (Only Supported Method)

1. Go to **Help Scout** → **My Apps** → **Create Private App**
2. Fill in app details and select required scopes:
   - At minimum: **Read** access to Mailboxes and Conversations
3. Copy your credentials from the Help Scout UI
4. Use in configuration as shown below

> **Note**: Help Scout API uses OAuth2 Client Credentials flow exclusively. Personal Access Tokens are not supported.

### Credential Terminology

Environment variables match Help Scout's UI exactly:

| Help Scout UI | Environment Variable | Description |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **App ID** | `HELPSCOUT_APP_ID` | Your OAuth2 client identifier |
| **App Secret** | `HELPSCOUT_APP_SECRET` | Your OAuth2 client secret |

**Alternative variable names** (also supported):
- `HELPSCOUT_CLIENT_ID` / `HELPSCOUT_CLIENT_SECRET` (OAuth2 standard naming)
- `HELPSCOUT_API_KEY` (legacy)

## Features

- **Advanced Search**: Multi-status conversation search, content filtering, boolean queries
- **Smart Analysis**: Conversation summaries, thread retrieval, inbox monitoring
- **Enterprise Security**: PII redaction, secure token handling, comprehensive audit logs
- **High Performance**: Built-in caching, rate limiting, automatic retry logic
- **Easy Integration**: Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Continue.dev, and more

## Tools & Capabilities

### Quick Guide: Which tool should I use?

- **Listing tickets:** `searchConversations` - No keywords needed, great for "show recent/closed/active tickets"
- **Finding by keyword:** `comprehensiveConversationSearch` - Searches content for specific words
- **Lookup ticket #:** `structuredConversationFilter` - Direct ticket number lookup
- **Complex filters:** `advancedConversationSearch` - Email domains, tag combinations

### Core Search Tools

| Tool | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `searchConversations` | Time/status filtering - List conversations by date, status, inbox | "Recent tickets", "closed last week", "active conversations" |
| `comprehensiveConversationSearch` | Keyword search - Find conversations containing specific words | "Find billing issues", "tickets about bug XYZ" |
| `structuredConversationFilter` | ID/number lookup - Filter by discovered IDs or ticket number | "Show ticket #42839", "Rep John's queue" (after finding John's ID) |
| `advancedConversationSearch` | Complex boolean - Email domains, tag combos, separated content/subject | "All @acme.com conversations", "urgent AND billing tags" |
| `searchInboxes` | ⚠️ *Deprecated* - Find inboxes by name | Use server instructions instead |
| `listAllInboxes` | ⚠️ *Deprecated* - List all inboxes with IDs | Use server instructions instead |

### Analysis & Retrieval Tools

| Tool | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `getConversationSummary` | Customer message + latest staff reply summary (with inline image metadata) | Quick conversation overview |
| `getThreads` | Complete conversation message history (with `attachmentCount` and `inlineImages` per thread) | Full context analysis |
| `getAttachments` | List attachment metadata across all threads | See what files/screenshots a customer attached |
| `getAttachmentData` | Download a specific attachment (inline for small images, temp file for large) | View customer screenshots |
| `getServerTime` | Current server timestamp | Time-relative searches |

### Reporting Tools

| Tool | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `listUsers` | List all Help Scout agents with IDs, emails, and roles | Get user IDs for per-agent reports |
| `getCompanyReport` | All agents compared side-by-side — replies sent, customers helped, happiness scores | Team-wide agent comparison |
| `getUserReport` | Deep dive on a single agent — response time, resolution time, handle time, conversation counts | Individual agent performance |
| `getProductivityReport` | Team-wide metrics — first response time, resolution time, handle time distributions, replies per resolution | Team productivity analysis |

### Inbox Auto-Discovery (v1.6.0+)

When the server connects, it automatically discovers all available inboxes and includes them in the server instructions. AI agents can reference inbox IDs directly without calling lookup tools first.

Example server instructions snippet:
```
## Available Inboxes (3 total)
  - "Support Inbox" (ID: 12345)
  - "Sales Inquiries" (ID: 67890)
  - "Billing Questions" (ID: 24680)
```

### Resources (Dynamic Discovery)

- `helpscout://inboxes` - List all accessible inboxes
- `helpscout://conversations` - Search conversations with filters
- `helpscout://threads` - Get thread messages for a conversation
- `helpscout://clock` - Current server timestamp

> **Note**: Resources are discovered dynamically at runtime through MCP protocol, not declared in the extension manifest.

## Search Examples

> **Key Distinction**: Use `searchConversations` (without query) for **listing** conversations, use `comprehensiveConversationSearch` (with search terms) for **finding** specific content.

> **v1.6.0+**: When no status is specified, searches automatically include all statuses (active, pending, closed).

### Listing Recent Conversations
```javascript
// Best for "show me recent tickets" - searches ALL statuses by default
searchConversations({
  limit: 25,
  sort: "createdAt",
  order: "desc"
})

// To filter to specific status, specify it explicitly
searchConversations({
  status: "active",
  limit: 25
})
```

### Content-Based Search
```javascript
// Best for "find tickets about X" - requires search terms
comprehensiveConversationSearch({
  searchTerms: ["urgent", "billing"],
  timeframeDays: 60,
  inboxId: "256809"
})
```

### Content-Specific Searches
```javascript
// Search in message bodies and subjects
comprehensiveConversationSearch({
  searchTerms: ["refund", "cancellation"],
  searchIn: ["both"],
  timeframeDays: 30
})

// Customer organization search
advancedConversationSearch({
  emailDomain: "company.com",
  contentTerms: ["integration", "API"],
  status: "active"
})
```

### Help Scout Query Syntax
```javascript
// Advanced query syntax support
searchConversations({
  query: "(body:\"urgent\" OR subject:\"emergency\") AND tag:\"escalated\"",
  status: "active"
})
```

## Configuration Options

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HELPSCOUT_APP_ID` | App ID from Help Scout My Apps | Required |
| `HELPSCOUT_APP_SECRET` | App Secret from Help Scout My Apps | Required |
| `HELPSCOUT_DEFAULT_INBOX_ID` | Default inbox ID for scoped searches (improves LLM context) | None (searches all inboxes) |
| `HELPSCOUT_BASE_URL` | Help Scout API endpoint | `https://api.helpscout.net/v2/` |
| `REDACT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` | Hide message bodies in responses | `false` |
| `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | Cache duration for API responses | `300` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging verbosity (`error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`) | `info` |

*Legacy variables `HELPSCOUT_CLIENT_ID`, `HELPSCOUT_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `ALLOW_PII` still supported for backwards compatibility.*

## Development

```bash
# Quick start
git clone https://github.com/drewburchfield/help-scout-mcp-server.git
cd help-scout-mcp-server
npm install && npm run build

# Create .env file with your credentials (from Help Scout My Apps)
echo "HELPSCOUT_APP_ID=your-app-id" > .env
echo "HELPSCOUT_APP_SECRET=your-app-secret" >> .env

# Start the server
npm start
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Failed**
```bash
# Verify your credentials
echo $HELPSCOUT_APP_ID
echo $HELPSCOUT_APP_SECRET

# Test with curl
curl -X POST https://api.helpscout.net/v2/oauth2/token \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=$HELPSCOUT_APP_ID&client_secret=$HELPSCOUT_APP_SECRET"
```

**Connection Timeouts**
- Check your network connection to `api.helpscout.net`
- Verify no firewall blocking HTTPS traffic
- Consider increasing `HTTP_SOCKET_TIMEOUT` environment variable

**Rate Limiting**
- The server automatically handles rate limits with exponential backoff
- Reduce concurrent requests if you see frequent 429 errors
- Monitor logs for retry patterns

**Empty Search Results**
- **Wrong tool choice**: Use `searchConversations` (no query) for listing, `comprehensiveConversationSearch` for content search
- **Empty search terms**: Don't use empty strings `[""]` with comprehensiveConversationSearch
- **Inbox ID issues**: Use inbox IDs from server instructions (auto-discovered on connect), not guessed values
- Verify inbox permissions with your API credentials
- Check conversation exists and you have access
- Try broader search terms or different time ranges

> **v1.6.0+**: Searches now include all statuses by default. If you're still getting empty results, verify the inbox ID matches one from the server instructions.
